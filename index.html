                        <div class="guide-description">
                          Chess is the world's most widely recognized activity of skill. In 1999, the International Olympic Committee officially determined that chess is a sport! The beauty of the game is that anyone can develop their chess skills, even as early as age 3, but it is impossible for humans to play perfectly. <br><br>
                          We believe that chess is most fun and beneficial when studied properly and played competitively. Unlike other activities, chess provides a pure decision-making arena where players receive clear feedback on each of their choices. This makes it an ideal vehicle for advancing academic, personal, and career success.<br><br>
                          Academically, the benefits of chess are well known. It helps students with their focus, work ethic, critical thinking, self-awareness, self-control, and patience. After playing a grueling six hour tournament game, sitting through SAT or AP testing feels like a walk in the park! Chess provides a microcosm in which students practice exerting themselves to study and build concrete skills, while having fun and embracing failure as part of the learning process.<br><br>
                          Personally, chess promotes healthy habits and a balanced lifestyle. The life skills chess develops&mdash;patience, forethought, sportsmanship, self-accountability&mdash;are highly relevant outside the classroom. Scholastic chess is often played in a co-ed team setting, so all of the social benefits of team sports are included as well. As one of the most popular games on the planet, whenever they visit a new country, city, or culture, students can connect with other people through chess.<br><br>
                          Career-wise, chess is one of the most compelling extracurriculars to list on a r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Being exposed to the mathematical logic of the game is helpful in quantitative and STEM careers. Also, significant creativity is involved at the chessboard. Marcel Duchamp famously stated that “while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists.”

                          Andy Trattner fell in love with chess during high school. He was fortunate to have a strong chess ecosystem in his community growing up, and he is very excited for the opportunity to create an even better experience for the next generation here on Bainbridge Island!<br><br>

                          Andy has founded and taught chess clubs and classes at the <a href="https://www.avalonfreelibrary.org/connect/about-library" target="_blank">Avalon Public Library</a>, <a href="https://www.e3civichigh.com/" target="_blank">e3 Civic High</a>, and <a href="http://chess.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT</a>, where he earned his bachelor's in mathematics with computer science after 3 years of classes. He also has entry-level as well as leadership experience working in aerospace engineering, academia, government, retail, social media, education, venture capital, and the nonprofit sector.
                          <br><br> Andy credits much of his academic and career success to the game of chess. He is recognized as an expert player by the United States Chess Federation (with a rating of <a href="http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?14538125" target="_blank">2089</a>) and can play a full game completely blindfolded.
